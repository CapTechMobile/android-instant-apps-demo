# Android Instant Apps Demo
This is a simple demo demonstrating an Android app which contains a base feature, and two child features.  Two instant apps can be run, each utilizing a child feature. Both child features demonstrate a dependency on resources from their common base feature.

This particular example is a Cactus Shop app.  Running different build configurations will install the main app, or one of the two instant apps.  Please see the related [blog]() for more instructions.
